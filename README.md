# kaliki-template

A [Copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io/) template for the Go + Flutter +
OpenAPI stack, Docker-first.

## Generate a project

```sh
uvx copier copy gh:kaliki-tech-labs/kaliki-template my-app
# or from a local checkout:
uvx copier copy . ../my-app
```

You'll be prompted for identity (name, Go module path, bundle id, db name) and
module choices (auth, mailer, verification method, caching, eventing, payments,
push, object storage, example domain). Observability is always included with a
no-op default.

## What you get

- **Backend** — Go (gin + pgx), config-from-YAML, goose migrations on startup,
  timeouts + graceful shutdown, and one example domain.
- **Observability** — OpenTelemetry tracing via `otelgin` + `otelpgx`, no-op
  until you point `observability.endpoint` at an OTLP/gRPC collector.
- **API** — OpenAPI specs as the contract source of truth.
- **Frontend** — Flutter (Riverpod + GoRouter) with a working auth flow and
  local widgets.
- **Docker** — `docker compose up --build` brings up postgres (+redis/redpanda/
  mailpit per flags) and the backend together.

## Test the template

```sh
./test-template.sh             # renders combos, go vet, docker smoke test
SKIP_DOCKER=1 ./test-template.sh   # render + go vet only (fast)
```

## Status

Working stack. Codegen pipeline, auth, Tier-2 modules, and CI are in place and
verified end-to-end (see `test-template.sh` / `.github/workflows/template-ci.yml`).

### Done
- [x] sqlc + oapi-codegen wiring (`items` is a full generated vertical slice)
- [x] redocly auto-discovery spec build + Dart client regen script
- [x] auth: JWT signup/login, email verification + password reset, argon2id,
      refresh-token rotation + revocation, and a protected `GET /auth/me`
- [x] transactional email (`mailer` flag): SMTP + SES + log transports, Mailpit
      in the local stack; `verification_method` flag (OTP code vs token link).
      Credentials are emailed/logged, never returned in API responses
- [x] Tier-2 modules: caching (redis), eventing (kafka + outbox), payments,
      push, object storage — integration points, gated by flags
- [x] transactional outbox relay worker (`cmd/workers`) for eventing
- [x] frontend auth flow: secure token storage, refresh interceptor, Riverpod
      auth controller, GoRouter redirect, login/signup/home screens, local
      widgets (no shared_ui package — extract one by hand if a 2nd app needs it)
- [x] API client generated via a swagger_parser fork supporting `x-dart-type`
      (`format: date` → `LocalDate`, not `DateTime`)
- [x] goose migrations (per-file transactional), applied on startup and in tests
- [x] OpenTelemetry tracing (otelgin + otelpgx), no-op until an OTLP/gRPC
      endpoint is configured
- [x] production hardening: HTTP server timeouts + signal-based graceful
      shutdown; refuses the dev JWT secret when `APP_ENV=production`
- [x] GitHub Actions matrix (renders + builds + tests minimal/default/full)
- [x] integration-style handler tests for `items` + `auth` (real DB, worked
      examples in `internal/testsupport`)

### Known gaps / possible next

Ordered roughly by payoff for a fresh project.

**Operational**
- **Structured logging.** Everything uses `log.Printf` + `gin.Default()`'s text
  logger. Ship `slog` (JSON handler) with request-id propagation so logs are
  queryable and correlate with traces.
- **Metrics + real health checks.** Tracing is wired but there's no meter
  provider / `/metrics` (Prometheus). `/health` returns `ok` unconditionally —
  split into liveness (`/health`, static) vs readiness (`/ready`, pings the
  pool + redis).
- **Rate limiting / brute-force protection** on `login`/`signup`/`reset`. Redis
  is already in the default stack — a per-IP + per-account limiter middleware is
  low effort, high value.

**Correctness / DX**
- **Lint in CI.** CI builds + tests but runs no `go vet` / `golangci-lint` /
  `staticcheck` / `gofmt -l` / `sqlc vet`, and the frontend only runs
  `flutter analyze` (no `flutter test`).
- **OpenAPI request validation.** oapi-codegen generates types but the spec is
  not enforced at runtime — wire `kin-openapi` validation middleware, or accept
  that handlers validate by hand and the spec is documentation only.
- **Worked example of a protected domain route.** `auth.Middleware()` and
  `/auth/me` exist, but `items` is intentionally public — there's no reference
  for auth-gated domain CRUD (the most-copied pattern in a real app).

**Lower priority / scope calls**
- No dependency automation (Dependabot/Renovate) — generated repos drift on
  pinned Go/npm/Flutter/action versions.
- No frontend deploy story (web build target / Dockerfile); backend is fully
  containerized, the Flutter side is not.
- DB connection pool is not tunable via config (`max_conns`, timeouts).
- `distroless/static` ships CA certs but no `tzdata` — timezone-aware formatting
  is UTC-only unless `time/tzdata` is imported.
